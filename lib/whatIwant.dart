/*All i want to do is
1. when i click on the add icon in the circleavater on the homepage, it adds a cart with the details from the list<ItemsModel> to the cart page.
2. also when i click on any product on the homepage, it takes me to the productdetails page with the details of the product or item i clicked on.
3.then on the product details page, the add or remove button will no longer be needed rather it will be needed on the cart page so when i click on either of them
it updates the quantity of the specific item needed and then a total of the cost of all items in the cart.
